# Nortek publications for reference

## 

Welcome to Nortek publication repository. In this collaborative webpage, we ask researches 
to include the citation of their research using Nortek instruments. Our idea is to inspire Nortek
users on doing cutting-edge research by giving ideas of instruments deployment, configuration,
setup and data analysis.

## Publications by industry

In this section, we split publications by type of industry: coastal engineering, 
aquaculture, renewable energy, dredging, ports and harbours, research and more.

## Publications by instruments

In this section, publications are separated by the instrument used during the research: 
Signatures, Velocimeters, AWACs, DVLs and more.

## Publications by environment

Estuaries, deep sea, laboratory, coastal, lakes and more.

## Publications by ecosystem

Coral reef, mangroove, seagrass meadows and more.
